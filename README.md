# Tree-rs
This is a Rust implementation of the Linux Tree command.

This implementation just as the original one explores the directory using a
recursive function.

Unlike the original implementation the printed colors are hard coded.

#### Flags
"-D" - specifies the directory to be explored, "." is the default 

"-L" - specifies the depth to explore

## To do
* [ ] Parse depth level via CLI
* [ ] Parse directory to explore via CLI
* [ ] Print executables in green
